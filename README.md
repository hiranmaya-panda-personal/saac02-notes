## Cloud Computing
1. On-demand self-service
2. Broad network access
3. Resource pooling
4. Rapid elasticity
5. Measured service

## Types of Cloud
1. Public Cloud = using 1 Public Cloud
2. Private Cloud = using on-premises *real* cloud
3. Multi-Cloud = using more than 1 public cloud
4. Hybrid Cloud = Public & Private Clouds

Hybrid Cloud != public cloud + legacy on-premises infrastructure (= Hybrid networking)

## Serivce Models
Infrastructure stack.

Based on the "Unit of consumption", the type of service model is defined.
Ex: EC2 instance's UoC is the OS, Netflix's UoC is the application & nothing else.

On-premises vs DC Hosted - Traditionally used. Datacentre hosting vendor provided Facilities for consumption.

Cloud service Models
1. IaaS - UoC is O/S
2. PaaS (esp. used by the Developers) - UoC is Runtime
3. SaaS - UoC is the application
