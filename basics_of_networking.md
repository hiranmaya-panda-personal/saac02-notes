## OSI 7-Layer Networking Model
- Layer 1: Physical
- Layer 2: Data Link
- Layer 3: Network
- Layer 4: Transport
- Layer 5: Session
- Layer 6: Presentation
- Layer 7: Application

Layer 1, Layer 2, Layer 3 constitute the "MEDIA LAYERS".

Layer4, Layer 5, Layer 6, Layer 7 constitue the "HOST LAYERS".

The software that manages Layer 1 through 7 can be termed as the "NETWORKING STACK".

## Layer 1: Physical
Defines transmission & receiving of *raw bit streams* between *a device* & a *shared physical medium*.

It may define voltage levels, timings, rates, distances, modules and connectors.

<ins>Network Hub:</ins>
Anything recieved on any port is transmitted to all other ports, including errors and collisions(multiple devices trying to transmit at once).

There is no device addressing. 

All data is processed by all devices.

L1 has <b>no media access control</b> and/or <b>collision detection</b>.
